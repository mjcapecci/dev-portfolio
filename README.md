This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Key Technologies

The following are the key technologies used in this portfolio website:

### Styled Components

This project was styled with the Styled Components library.
I am happy to report that styled components are convenient to work with and cultivate an awesome workflow.

### Serverless Functions

Instead of rolling a full Node.js backend, this project utilizes Netlify Serverless Functions for backend-oriented tasks. As of now, this is on display in the form submission found in the contact portion of the site.
