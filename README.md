This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Key Technologies

The following are the key technologies used in this portfolio website:

### Styled Components

This project was styled with the Styled Components library. I learned that Styled Components are fun to work with, and they may be my preffered way of handling CSS at this time.

### Serverless Functions

Instead of rolling a full Node.js backend, this project utilizes Netlify Serverless Functions for backend-oriented tasks. As of now, this is on display in the form submission found in the contact portion of the site.
